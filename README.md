# FiveLetters

It is project just for funny. There is a game "five letters". 

You have to guess a five letter word. If there is a letter from the proposed word in the hidden word, it is marked. If the position of the letter is in the same position as in the hidden word, this is also stipulated. Gradually, the search circle narrows. Only 6 attempts are given to guess the word.

This little program helps you quickly find the right word.
