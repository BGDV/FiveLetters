# FiveLetters

This project is just for fun. There is a game "five letters".

You need to guess a five letter word. If the hidden word contains a letter from the proposed word, it is indicated. If the position of the letter is the same as in the hidden word, this is also indicated. Gradually, the search circle narrows. Only 6 attempts are given to guess the word.

This little program will help you quickly find the right word.
